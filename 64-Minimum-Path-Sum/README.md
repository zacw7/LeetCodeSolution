# 64. Minimum Path Sum

**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

Given a _m_ x _n_ grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

__Note:__ You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

##### Example:
```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

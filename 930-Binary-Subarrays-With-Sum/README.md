# 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum

**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)

In an array `A` of `0`s and `1`s, how many __non-empty__ subarrays have sum `S`?

##### Example 1:
```
Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The 4 subarrays are bolded below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
```

##### Note:
1. `A.length <= 30000`
2. `0 <= S <= A.length`
3. `A[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

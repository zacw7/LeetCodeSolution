# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

**Easy**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)

We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is __exactly__ 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible [subsequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence).

##### Example:
```
Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```

__Note:__ The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.

# 177. Nth Highest Salary

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary/)

Write a SQL query to get the _n_<sup>th</sup> highest salary from the `Employee` table.

<pre>+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
</pre>

For example, given the above Employee table, the _n_<sup>th</sup> highest salary where _n_ = 2 is `200`. If there is no _n_<sup>th</sup> highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

Find the **k**th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

For example,  
Given `[3,2,1,5,6,4]` and k = 2, return 5.

**Note:**  
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

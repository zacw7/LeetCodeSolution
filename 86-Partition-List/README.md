# 86. Partition List

**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

Given a linked list and a value _x_, partition it such that all nodes less than _x_ come before nodes greater than or equal to _x_.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
##### Example:
```
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```

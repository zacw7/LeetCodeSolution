# 63. Unique Paths II

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

For example,  

There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

<pre>[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
</pre>

The total number of unique paths is `2`.

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.
